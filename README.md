iris
====

A simple, flat and bold GTK+ theme.

This repo contains my changes to the Iris Dark theme.  These include:

* Colour changes
* Changes to GtkHeaderBar-style windows:
    * Removed the 1px border
    * Added a 6px @link-color border to match my [Bar][bar] window theme
* Reduced the 20px horizontal padding on buttons to 4px (same as vertical)
* Made menu bars taller
* Maybe some other things
